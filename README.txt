-	Organizing web search results into clusters is an area of post-document retrieval processing.  When a user types a query in a search engine, most often we see results that may have multiple meanings and varying relevance to the user. This becomes more apparent when a user types in an ambiguous query like ‘Apple’ or ‘Jaguar’, which can mean multiple things like ‘Jaguar-the cat’ or ‘jaguar-the car’. Thus, this post-retrieval task plays an important role in returning the best results to the user.  
-	This task is mostly achieved by returning the results in the form of clusters to the user. Thus, the user can select the most relevant cluster of search results i.e. either ‘Jaguar-cat’ or ‘Jaguar-car’, which reduces the amount of browsing through non-relevant documents. 
-	The system implements a basic clustering solution that groups search results having similar documents in the same cluster. The 2 biggest components of any SRC system are the clustering and labeling components. The approach used in developing this system is the discriminative approach of clustering where the clustering of the documents takes precedence over the labeling of the clusters.
